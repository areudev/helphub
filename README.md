## Development

### Initial setup:

`npm run setup`

### Start dev server:

`npm run dev`

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get
started:

Username: kody Password: kodylovesyou

For logging with the other generated users just use their username as username
and password
